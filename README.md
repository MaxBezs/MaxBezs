### Hi I am Max 👋
<img src="https://github.com/MaxBezs/MaxBezs/blob/main/%D0%A1%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B9%204.png" alt="banner that says Monica Powell - software engineer, content creator and community organizer alongside a cartoon illustration of Monica">
I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and GraphQL. I recently was selected to be an inaugural <a href="https://www.instagram.com/max_bezs/">Instagram 🌟</a> based on my involvement in the tech community.  My interest in the React ecosystem led me to launch <a href="https://www.turbosquid.com/ru/Search/Artists/Max_Bezs">TurboSquid</a>, a community for women and non-binary ReactJS developers.
